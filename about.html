									<p class="leading">Blackpink is a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Lisa, and Rose.</p>
									<p>The group debuted on August 8, 2016, with their single Square One, which spawned "Whistle," their first number-one song in South Korea. The single also included "Boombayah," their first number one on Billboard World Digital Songs chart, which set the record as the most-viewed debut music video by a Korean act. With the group's commercial success in their first five months, they were hailed as the New Artist of the Year at the 31st Golden Disc Awards and the 26th Seoul Music Awards.

									Blackpink is the highest-charting female K-pop act on Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 55 with "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du", and on Billboard 200, peaking at number 40 with Square Up. They are the first and only K-pop girl group to enter and top Billboard's Emerging Artists chart. They are also the first female K-pop group to have four number-one singles on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart. At the time of its release, "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" set a record as the most-viewed Korean music video in 24 hours on YouTube.</p>

									<p>Blackpink became the first girl group that debuted under YG Entertainment in six years after 2NE1, with their debut single Square One, which was released on August 8, 2016. The first lead single, "Whistle," was produced by Teddy Park and Future Bounce and was written by Teddy Park, iKon's Kim Hanbin, and Bekuh BOOM. The second lead single, "Boombayah," was produced by Teddy Park and co-written by Bekuh BOOM. Its music video was directed by Seo Hyun-seung. The two title tracks charted at number one and two on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, and Blackpink are the fastest act to do so and the third Korean artist or group to hold the top two positions after label mates Psy and Big Bang. "Whistle" topped the digital, download, streaming, and mobile charts on Gaon in August 2016. They also reached number one on the weekly, popularity, music video, and K-pop music video charts of China's biggest music-streaming website QQ Music. Blackpink's first music show performance was aired on August 14, 2016 on SBS' Inkigayo. They won first place on Inkigayo 13 days after their debut, and broke the record for the shortest time for a girl group to win on a music program after debut. They wrapped up their promotions for Square One on September 11, 2016 with another win on Inkigayo.</p>

									<p>Blackpink released their second single album Square Two with the lead singles "Playing with Fire" and "Stay" on November 1, 2016. The songs were produced by Teddy Park with R.Tee and Seo Won Jin. They performed their comeback stage on Inkigayo on November 6 and on Mnet's M Countdown on November 10, 2016. "Playing with Fire" was their second single to hit number one on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart. In South Korea, "Playing with Fire" peaked at number three while "Stay" managed to reach the tenth spot.</p>
									<p>Their debut EP titled Square Up contained four tracks, including the singles "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" and "Forever Young", the single "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" debuted at number 17 on the Official Trending Chart in the United Kingdom. The single also debuted at number 55 on Billboard Hot 100 where they became, by far, the highest-charting K-pop girl-group ever. "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" also debuted at number 39 on the US Streaming Songs tally, where Blackpink became the first K-pop girl group to chart a title. The single also sat atop Billboard World Digital Songs, making it the group's fourth number one hit on the chart. Square Up also brought the group their first entry and the highest-charting to date by an all-female K-pop group on the US Billboard 200, debuting at number 40. The EP also topped the Billboard World Albums chart and debuted at number one on Gaon Albums Chart. The single "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" peaked at number one on the Digital, Download, Streaming and Mobile charts on Gaon in the last week of June 2018, while "Forever Young" also managed to peak under top five.</p>
